# Biologically motivated Artificial Neural Environment 

This is a prototype for an artificial neural network environment using Erlang. It will be strongly biologically motivated.

# Getting Started

## Setup

Any erlang module (file) that has a start function should work as an example. As this gets more fleshed out I'll create an examples directory.

You'll need to compile any files you will use and any files the said files depend on (get it?). With Erlang you can do this at the command line like so
    $ erlc file.erl
which will generate the object file `file.beam`. However, since these files are currently meant to be used interactively in the Erlang VM you can just as easily compile files during your Erlang session like so
    > c(file).

## Usage

To use a given example you'll first need to understand the example (I'm serious). Then, you'll run the start function of the given example in the Erlang VM e.g. `> example_module:start_function().`.

## Complete Example

With Erlang installed (in a Unixish system). We'll run a simple integrate and fire model.

	$ cd bane/if
	$ erl
    Erlang R14B01 (erts-5.8.2) [source] [64-bit] [smp:2:2] [rq:2] [async-threads:0] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

    Eshell V5.8.2  (abort with ^G)
    1> c(simple).
    {ok,simple}
    2> simple:start().
    {<0.38.0>,<0.39.0>}
    3> flush().
    Shell got {hi,{10,15,37}}
    Shell got {hi,{10,15,38}}
    Shell got {hi,{10,15,39}}
    Shell got {hi,{10,15,40}}
    Shell got {hi,{10,15,41}}
    ok
    4> q().
    ok

That's it. We flushed the messages we recieved (at the shell process) and noticed that we recieved one every second, which makes since, because our model has a single cell recieving input at 60Hz and with a threshold of 60 units (whatever our neurotransmitter quanta is).
